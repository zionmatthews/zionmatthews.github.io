Hi, Im Zion Matthews. A game programmer/indie game developer, with an
inspiration to create horror, action, and many different other genres of games alike.
I spent a year learning unity and 3 years learning unreal. With everything I
learned, you can never learn enough when it comes to creation. So im always
looking forward to learning and expanding my knowledge.
